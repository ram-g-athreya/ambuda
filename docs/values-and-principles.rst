Values and principles
=====================

Ambuda's mission is to build a comprehensive library of Sanskrit literature and make it
accessible to all. Our values and principles are designed to help us realize this
ambitious goal.


Values
------

As a library project, we value trust, sustainability, and long-term thinking in
everything we do.

From a community perspective, we send out regular project updates on our mailing
list, track technical work on GitHub, and have more open discussion on Discord.
Everyone is welcome to join in on our ongoing discussion.

From a code perspective, we build in public so that everyone can see how our project
is doing and participate in it themselves. It means that we bias toward obvious and
boring technology that anyone can read and understand. It also means that we take
care to write code that is clear and simple.

From a data perspective, we rely on open and public data and produce open and public
data in return. Although licensing rights often prevent it, we strive to release our
texts under a `CC0`_ (public domain) license.


Principles
----------

Ambuda's tech stack follows a few basic principles:

1. Our readers care about our content and features, *not* our technical stack.
   All of our technical work should be connected to a clear user problem. We
   must not build features just because they're interesting technically.

2. The hidden enemy of any tech project is complexity. Unless there is a *very*
   good reason to embrace it, we should keep complexity low in all parts of our
   project.

3. Our core team is an ever-changing group of volunteers with various
   backgrounds and skills. When in doubt, we should prefer simple, well-known,
   and well-documented technologies that have been repeatedly tested in
   production systems.
