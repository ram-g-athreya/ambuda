[Ambuda](https://ambuda.org) is an online Sanskrit library. This repository contains Ambuda's core
code, and this README will show you how to build and change it.

## Quickstart

This quickstart will show you how to:

- start Ambuda with Docker
- create an admin user
- upload content to the site

### Starting Ambuda with Docker

The quickest way to run Ambuda on your computer is to use `docker compose` from your command line.

> [!TIP]
> You can install `docker compose` through either the [Docker website][docker] or your favorite
> package manager. If you have a Unix machine and don't like Docker Desktop, we recommend
> [Colima][colima].
>
> [docker]: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
> [colima]: https://github.com/abiosoft/colima

Once you have `docker` configured, starting the site is simple:

```
make ambuda-dev
```

The `make ambuda-dev` command will do the following:

- Build an Ambuda Docker image. This will likely take a few minutes the first time it runs, but it
  will be substantially faster on subsequent runs.

- Start Ambuda's main services: the web server, a Celery pool for background tasks, and Redis for
  Celery interop.

- Initialize a Sqlite database with sample data. Data is persisted to the `data/` directory and
  survives across restarts.

- Set up hot reloading for Python, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Start the web server at http://localhost:5000.

To quit, press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you ever run into build issues with `make ambuda-dev`, first run `make ambuda-dev-build`
> then try again.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Run CLI commansd within `make ambuda-dev-shell`.

## Creating an admin user

Once the Docker service is up, create an admin user so that you can log in:

```
make ambuda-dev-shell

# Inside the shell

# This command creates a new user.
> uv run cli.py create-user

# This command assigns the `admin` role to your new user.
> uv run cli.py add-role --username <your-username> --role admin
```

After you've created your admin user, go to `http://localhost:5000/sign-in` to sign in.

### Creating test data

(Under revision.)

Use `create-toy-data` to create a toy project.

```
make ambuda-dev-shell

# Inside the shell
> uv run cli.py create-toy-data
```


### Uploading content to the site

(Under revision.)

Once you've logged in as an admin user go to `https://localhost:5000/admin/` to open the Admin UI.


## Documentation

Our docs contain information about our tech stack, architecture, design decisions, and so on. To
read them, see the `docs` folder, or build them from scratch and open them in your browser:

```
$ make docs
$ open docs/_build/html/index.html
```

## Troubleshooting

- `table already exists`
  - Run `make ambuda-dev-shell` then uv run alembic upgrade head`.
  - If problems persist, delete the local database and try again.
